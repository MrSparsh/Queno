# Queno
When customers are dissatisfied with the queue they’re in, they may jump to another “better” queue. But the idea of “better” is relative. The queue might look shorter than the one a customer is in, but that doesn’t mean it’s working more efficiently or moving faster. The goal is to eliminate queue jumping entirely so customers don’t get frustrated when they choose the wrong line.
It's an android application to join queue virtually. You can enter in any line without actually going there by joining the queue by our app and you will be notified at the right time when to leave your place .

If you want to join more than one queue on a given day then you can book the time either by yourself or you can use our algorithm which will find an optimal time for you to leave your home and will find an optimal path you have to follow.

## Features Implemented
* Join any queue virtually at your your prefrable time.
* Get current status of your queue at any time.
* Join more than one queue with minimum waiting time which also consideres the distance you have to travel.

## Future Scope
* Decreasing the waiting time more by making a learning model which model which will return the average traffic at any time and regulating our queue management according to that.
