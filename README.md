# Queno
It's an android application to join queue virtually. You can enter in any line without actually going there by joining the queue by our app and you will be 
notified at the right time .

If you want to join more than one queue on a given day then you can book the time either by yourself or you can use our algorithm which will find an optimal time
for you to leave your home and will find an optimal path you have to follow.
